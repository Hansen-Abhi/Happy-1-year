                but youâ€™re still in love with me cherryluu and I know it..!! ðŸ˜…ðŸ˜…</p>
                
            <p>thanxiiii for coming into my life like Iâ€™ve told you before I admit it without you this wouldnâ€™t have lasted anyone else wouldâ€™ve left me by now but you? youâ€™re a blessing in my life honestly even if I have to wait another 4 years for you to fully accept me itâ€™ll all be worth it when youâ€™re finally mine I couldnâ€™t ask god for anything more than that...</p>
                
            <p>what a journey itâ€™s been! seriously looking back at this whole year itâ€™s like a little movie reel love laughter sweet memories tears painâ€¦ weâ€™ve felt it all every single emotion weâ€™ve been through so much together nana
                
            <p>each moment every up and down just makes our story even more beautiful when we finally make it happen all these struggles we went through will feel so worth it weâ€™ll look back and think wow look how far weâ€™ve come every challenge every little victory will add to that feeling that weâ€™ve built something real and lasting this journey is ours and it's going to be amazing I promise Iâ€™ll make sure itâ€™s the best story ever</p>
                
            <p>I know I havenâ€™t always been the person who truly understands you there's this fear in me this fear of losing you that brings out the worst in me I know I'm not the best I'm far from perfect I feel like Iâ€™m someone who can be easily replaced and that thought makes me feel so low Itâ€™s what drives me to overthink, to overreact to assume things I know itâ€™s made you feel like Iâ€™m toxic and that you're fed up</p>
                
            <p>october 9thâ€¦ that day was a nightmare that fight changed everything seeing your frustration and anger it hit me so hard I realized I canâ€™t be without you It was like the fear of losing you became so real that day showed me my worst fear and it was the hardest thing I never want to feel that again and Iâ€™m going to change Iâ€™m already trying I just need your support like always as I work on myself Isnâ€™t that what love is about? becoming better for each other? and I want to be that person for you always I know Iâ€™ve hurt you countless times acted without thinking, said things I shouldnâ€™t have my overthinking has made me say hurtful things without realizing how deeply they would affect you but despite everything youâ€™ve been nothing but a blessing in my life you always tell me things openly knowing exactly how I tend to overthink and yet you still work to fix things between us 
                and me? Iâ€™ve been stubborn failing to really understand you, and Iâ€™ve ended up hurting you Iâ€™m so sorry nana I want to be better for you for us thanxii for staying with me through it all I know Iâ€™ve said this a hundred times but I have no shame in admitting it again Iâ€™m grateful for you and Iâ€™m determined to be the best I can be for us</p>
          
                
            <p>I know what you really need love isnâ€™t about buying gifts sending cute texts or something you want me to truly understand you you want me to talk about everything to share everything even the smallest things that might seem unimportant you want that openness that connection and I promise Iâ€™ll become that person Iâ€™ll be the one who shares who listens who understands I promise soon Iâ€™ll be everything youâ€™ve wanted me to be </p>
                
            <p>even if I have to search through all of eternity and the entire universe after this life I would find you again Iâ€™m so madly in love with you youâ€™re my everything and nothing will ever change that</p>
                
            <p>19-06-2024 wednesday the day I hugged you for the first time a proper tight hug It felt like the most peaceful place Iâ€™d ever been. It was one of the best feelings I could ever imagine thatâ€™s why whenever I meet you I canâ€™t help but hug you It just feels so damn good
                
            <p>since you came into my life everything has changed so much you taught me how to love how to care and youâ€™ve been there with me through every struggle Iâ€™ve faced youâ€™re truly a blessing in my life and Iâ€™m so grateful for everything we share
                
            <p>I really canâ€™t stop adoring you like ever seriously every time I see you I fall in love with you even harder just ask me about how I react when you wear traditional outfits trust me my reactions go completely off the charts! I become a total mess acting like the craziest person in the world every single time
                
            <p>and donâ€™t get me started on your hair when you rock that traditional hairstyle with a bun itâ€™s the perfect combination you just casually exist and Iâ€™m over here losing my mind in a never ending loop when you get ready you look absolutely gorgeous I mean how did God even create you? those eyes seriously theyâ€™re the best one look from you and my whole world flips upside down Itâ€™s not just your beauty those eyes have a way of speaking that leaves me completely mesmerized</p>
                
            <p>and your lips theyâ€™re like soft lines drawn with purpose a quiet beauty that instantly captures my attention they have a warmth and a rich natural color reminiscent of clay shaped by the most skilled hands when you speak or smile every movement feels like part of a delicate dance as if your lips hold stories and secrets just waiting to be unveiled 
                thereâ€™s a strength and softness to them like pottery that has been lovingly crafted and polished to perfection delicate yet resilient they carry a soothing magic inviting and timeless a little masterpiece all on their own rach time I see your lips Iâ€™m reminded of the beauty in every moment we share how they make even the simplest words feel profoundly special Itâ€™s as if they have the power to turn ordinary moments into cherished memories making my heart swell with every glance</p>
                
            <p>on this day I promise nana that Iâ€™ll change into the man youâ€™ve always wanted me to be Iâ€™ll work on myself and I hope youâ€™ll be right there with me during this transformation I canâ€™t express enough how grateful I am to have you in my life I truly feel blessed to call you mine and for that I am forever thankful to god your support means everything to me and Iâ€™m excited for the journey ahead together</p>
